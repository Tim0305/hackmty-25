## ⚙️ Technologies Used  

### 🔩 Back-end  
- **Python**  
- **PyTorch**  
- **YOLOv8**  
- **Roboflow**  

The back-end handles **object detection** using a computer vision model trained to identify products in captured images.  

### 💻 Front-end  
- **React**  
- **JavaScript**  

The front-end provides a modern and responsive interface for displaying detection results and managing processed data.
